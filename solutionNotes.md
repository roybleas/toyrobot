Notes and Assumptions:

Any malformed or unknown instruction will cause all instructions to be rejected and application to abend.

A # at the beginning of any input file line will cause the line to be ignored and treated as a comment.

When loading multiple files each file will end with a LineFeed or space so commands do not merge together.
